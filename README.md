# Vild
This is new console text editor like nano. If you wan't console editor, but don't wan't use nano and can't use vim, then welcome. Now I try to solve problem with scrolling and inserting copied info
# Changes
Changed functions: 1) appended more c++ references and getting lines vector; 2) changed fileworking:readinfo function(more readable). Also appended macros.h file with macros like uint - unsigned int and using for all .cpp files
